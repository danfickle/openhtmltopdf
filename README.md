OPEN HTML TO PDF
---------

CURRENTY SEEKING FEEDBACK
========
+ [Roadmap for version 1](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/170)

OVERVIEW
========
Open HTML to PDF is a pure-Java library for rendering arbitrary well-formed XML/XHTML (and even HTML5)
using CSS 2.1 for layout and formatting, outputting to PDF or images.

Use this library to generated nice looking PDF documents. But be aware that you can not throw modern HTML5+ at
this engine and expect a great result. You must special craft the HTML document for this library and 
use it's extended CSS feature like [#31](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/31) or
[#32](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/32) 
to get good results. Avoid floats near page breaks and use table layouts.

CHANGELOG
========

head - 0.0.1-RC15-SNAPSHOT
========

0.0.1-RC14
========
+ IMPORTANT: This release was brought forward so that we link against PDFBOX-2.0.11 as previous versions had a security vulnerability when parsing arbitary PDF files.
  While I believe this should not impact this project directly, having an insecure library on your classpath may be dangerous if you use it for other tasks.
