/**
 * <p>
 * A SAX EntityResolver for common entity references and DTDs in X/HTML
 * processing. Maps official entity references to local copies to avoid network
 * lookup. The local copies are stored in the source tree under /entities, and
 * the references here are resolved by a system ClassLoader. As long as the
 * entity files are in the classpath (or bundled in the FS jar), they will be
 * picked up.
